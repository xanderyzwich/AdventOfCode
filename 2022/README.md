# 2022

Executing this year in Java, and it's a LOT different from my usual Python. It's also a lot different from working in a large java project. 

## Layout

### /data
All data files named in format `day{x}-{data/example}.txt`
For consistency data files should end with a blank line.

### /src 
There's a util package to keep boilerplate out of solutions
Each day is implemented as a class

### /test
Each day has tests
