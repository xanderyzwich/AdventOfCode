# Advent of Code

## This Repository
A catch-all for my AoC solutions through the years. 

Directory structure breaks down the years and days. 

Tests are defined to match the examples given, and input data is either stored in variable or data file depending on size.  

## The source of the challenges

[Per the website](https://adventofcode.com/2021/about):  

"Advent of Code is an Advent calendar of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill sets and skill levels that can be solved in any programming language you like. People use them as a speed contest, interview prep, company training, university coursework, practice problems, or to challenge each other."
